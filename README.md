PROJECT TITLE: Number System Converter
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Gain experience in java by making a number converter
VERSION or DATE:
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run in a Java compiler and follow the instructions as it prompts you.
AUTHORS: Andra Dartarian Jorden Williams 
ITTERATIONS AND REVISIONS: 
	At one point, the file called CompleteSystem only converted any base to base 10, then I created ReverseFullSystem to turn base 10 to whatever base you wanted. Once I finished ReverseFullSystem I combined them into FullSystem to allow conversion to and from any base with base 10 being the conversion point. 
	In the process of writing CompleteSystem I had to test the ASCII value of all the characters so I can easily use letters for bases larger than 10. However, changed from using the ASCII value to finding the character's location in a static array

AVAILABLE CHARACTER ARRAY:
char[] CHARCTERS={'0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','J','K','L','M','N','O','P','Q','R','S','T','U','V','W','X','Y','Z'}; *can be modified in the code to accomodate more bases by using special characters
